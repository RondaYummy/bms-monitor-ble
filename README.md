# BMS Monitor [BLE]
## üîã Monitoring System for JK-BMS and Deye Inverter

This application provides full real-time monitoring of your energy system.  
It connects to:

- **JK-BMS** via Bluetooth low energy (using the `bleak` library)
- **Deye Inverter** via WiFi stick (using `pysolarmanv5`)

### üß† Key Features:
- üîã Real-time monitoring of battery and inverter data
- - Battery voltage, current, power, SOC, SOH
- - Cell temperatures, internal resistance, cycle count, balancing
- - Solar generation, home consumption, grid import/export

- üå°Ô∏è Automatic alerts for temperature or imbalance

- ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic power balancing with Tapo smart plugs
- - **Dynamic Load Shedding:** Automated power balancing to prevent inverter overload by switching Tapo smart plugs and reporting the number of devices disabled.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WEB PUSH Notifications
Critical events (e.g. overheating, cell imbalance, low charge) are sent as push notifications to the PWA frontend.

### üì± Progressive Web App (PWA)
The frontend is a PWA that works offline, supports mobile devices, and receives browser push notifications.

### üöÄ Why it's better:
- **No limitations of native apps** (e.g. Bluetooth only from a phone)
- **All data in one place** ‚Äî accessible from any device
- **Runs autonomously on Raspberry Pi 5**, with no cloud dependency, 24/7

> Full control over your energy system ‚Äî stable, local, and convenient.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Before Using Deye Inverter and Tapo Sockets

To ensure stable system operation, you must **assign static IP addresses** to the inverter and Tapo sockets via your router settings. This prevents random IP changes after reboots and guarantees continuous connectivity.

## ‚úÖ How to do this

1. Open your router‚Äôs admin panel in a browser:
   ```
   http://192.168.31.1
   ```

2. Navigate to the section:
   ```
   DHCP > Static Leases / Address Reservation / IP Binding
   ```

3. Add the **MAC address of the inverter's WiFi stick** and assign it a static IP address. Example:

   - **MAC:** `DC:4F:22:xx:xx:xx`
   - **IP:** `192.168.31.39`

4. Add your **Tapo smart plug** the same way:

   - **MAC:** `AC:84:C6:xx:xx:xx`
   - **IP:** `192.168.31.110`

5. Save the configuration.

6. Restart your **router** or **devices** to apply the changes.

---

üîÅ **After this setup**, the IP addresses will no longer change and your system will maintain a stable connection with the inverter and smart plugs.

‚úÖ This is highly recommended for all automation systems that depend on consistent local network addresses.

#### Deye
To connect to the inverter, you need to pass the following variables: INVERTER_IP, LOGGER_SN.

#### TP-Link Tapo
To connect to a Tapo outlet, you need to specify the outlet IP and EMAIL and PASSWORD from the official Tapo app.

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

<code>Graph TD
  BMS[JK-BMS] --> PythonApp[Python Backend]
  Deye[Deye Inverter] --> PythonApp
  PythonApp --> DB[SQLite DB]
  PythonApp --> PWA[Frontend (PWA)]
  PythonApp --> Push[Web Push Notifications]
</code>
  
## First steps:
#### To access your application from outside the local network, you need to get a static IP address from your Internet provider. And etup Nginx and SSL ( https://github.com/RondaYummy/bms-monitor-ble/blob/main/docs/nginx.md )

### Make sure that the systemctl service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
```

### Build Docker:
```bash
yarn build
```

### To copy static resources after a manual build:
```bash
yarn static
```

### [PROD] - [DEV] 
```bash
yarn prod
yarn dev
```

### [AUTO] Deploy via PM2

#### Preparing:
```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/reboot-nopasswd
chmod +x deploy.sh
npm install pm2 -g
```

### [AUTO] Deploy start:
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Clear Database [Example]
```bash
docker ps
docker exec -it bms-monitor-ble-python-app-1 bash
rm /app/data/*.db
exit
docker compose restart
```

## üöÄ Motivation

The official BMS app left me deeply dissatisfied due to its lack of critical features and usability limitations. It didn‚Äôt provide **real-time notifications** for important events like low battery charge, missing charging sessions, or abnormal cell behavior. Monitoring these parameters while physically standing next to the BMS with a smartphone felt inefficient and outdated.

I envisioned a solution where I could **access, monitor, and control my entire energy system from anywhere**, without being tied to a specific location or mobile app.

So I decided to build my own system ‚Äî starting with **Python** and a lightweight **web interface** that consolidates all the essential features the official tools lacked. My application adds:

- üîî **Web push notifications** for overheating, cell imbalance, and battery issues  
- üåç **Remote access via PWA**, accessible from any browser or device  
- üìä **Advanced data visualization** through real-time charts and logs

As the project grew, I expanded beyond the BMS:

- üí° **TP-Link Tapo smart plugs** were integrated to enable **remote power control** of connected devices (e.g. chargers, inverters, routers). Now I can automatically turn them on/off based on battery state or schedule.  
- ‚ö° **Deye Inverter** support was added via Wi-Fi stick to monitor **solar generation**, **grid consumption**, and **system balancing**.  
- üß† All these components now work **together as one intelligent system**, running autonomously on a **Raspberry Pi 5**, without relying on the cloud.

> The goal was simple: **bring clarity, control, and automation** to my energy setup ‚Äî in a way that‚Äôs stable, open, and privacy-friendly.

This project is my attempt to create a fully local, integrated, and extensible energy management platform ‚Äî something I believe every DIY energy enthusiast should have access to.
