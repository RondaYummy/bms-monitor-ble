# BMS Monitor [BLE]
## üîã Monitoring System for JK-BMS and Deye Inverter

This application provides full real-time monitoring of your energy system.  
It connects to:

- **JK-BMS** via Bluetooth low energy (using the `bleak` library)
- **Deye Inverter** via WiFi stick (using `pysolarmanv5`)

### üß† Key Features:
- Battery voltage, current, power, SOC, SOH
- Cell temperatures, internal resistance, cycle count, balancing
- Solar generation, home consumption, grid import/export

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WEB PUSH Notifications
Critical events (e.g. overheating, cell imbalance, low charge) are sent as push notifications to the PWA frontend.

### üì± Progressive Web App (PWA)
The frontend is a PWA that works offline, supports mobile devices, and receives browser push notifications.

### üöÄ Why it's better:
- **No limitations of native apps** (e.g. Bluetooth only from a phone)
- **All data in one place** ‚Äî accessible from any device
- **Runs autonomously on Raspberry Pi 5**, with no cloud dependency, 24/7

> Full control over your energy system ‚Äî stable, local, and convenient.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Before Using Deye Inverter and Tapo Sockets

To ensure stable system operation, you must **assign static IP addresses** to the inverter and Tapo sockets via your router settings. This prevents random IP changes after reboots and guarantees continuous connectivity.

## ‚úÖ How to do this

1. Open your router‚Äôs admin panel in a browser:
   ```
   http://192.168.31.1
   ```

2. Navigate to the section:
   ```
   DHCP > Static Leases / Address Reservation / IP Binding
   ```

3. Add the **MAC address of the inverter's WiFi stick** and assign it a static IP address. Example:

   - **MAC:** `DC:4F:22:xx:xx:xx`
   - **IP:** `192.168.31.39`

4. Add your **Tapo smart plug** the same way:

   - **MAC:** `AC:84:C6:xx:xx:xx`
   - **IP:** `192.168.31.110`

5. Save the configuration.

6. Restart your **router** or **devices** to apply the changes.

---

üîÅ **After this setup**, the IP addresses will no longer change and your system will maintain a stable connection with the inverter and smart plugs.

‚úÖ This is highly recommended for all automation systems that depend on consistent local network addresses.

#### Deye
To connect to the inverter, you need to pass the following variables: INVERTER_IP, LOGGER_SN.

#### TP-Link Tapo
To connect to a Tapo outlet, you need to specify the outlet IP and EMAIL and PASSWORD from the official Tapo app.

## First steeps:
### To access your application from outside the local network, you need to get a static IP address from your Internet provider.
### And etup Nginx and SSL ( https://github.com/RondaYummy/bms-monitor-ble/blob/main/docs/nginx.md )

### Make sure that the systemctl service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
```

### Build Docker:
```bash
yarn build
```

### To copy static resources after a manual build:
```bash
yarn static
```

### [PROD] - [DEV] 
```bash
yarn prod
yarn dev
```

### [AUTO] Deploy via PM2

#### Preparing:
```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/reboot-nopasswd
chmod +x deploy.sh
npm install pm2 -g
```

### [AUTO] Deploy start:
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Clear Database [Example]
```bash
docker ps
docker exec -it bms-monitor-ble-python-app-1 bash
rm /app/data/*.db
exit
docker compose restart
```

## Motivation
The official app left me dissatisfied due to its lack of essential features. It doesn't provide critical notifications, such as alerts in Telegram for a low battery level, missing charging, or potential issues with the BMS itself. Monitoring these parameters while standing next to the BMS with my phone felt inefficient and inconvenient. I envisioned a solution where I could access all this data and functionality from anywhere in the world, without being tethered to a specific location.

Inspired by this need, I decided to create my own project using Python and develop a web application that integrates all these features in one place. Unlike the official app, my application includes real-time notifications, remote accessibility, and, importantly, data visualization through detailed charts‚Äîsomething the official app also lacks. This project is a step toward simplifying BMS monitoring and ensuring a seamless user experience, no matter where I am.
