## Motivation
The official app left me dissatisfied due to its lack of essential features. It doesn't provide critical notifications, such as alerts in Telegram for a low battery level, missing charging, or potential issues with the BMS itself. Monitoring these parameters while standing next to the BMS with my phone felt inefficient and inconvenient. I envisioned a solution where I could access all this data and functionality from anywhere in the world, without being tethered to a specific location.

Inspired by this need, I decided to create my own project using Python and develop a web application that integrates all these features in one place. Unlike the official app, my application includes real-time notifications, remote accessibility, and, importantly, data visualization through detailed chartsâ€”something the official app also lacks. This project is a step toward simplifying BMS monitoring and ensuring a seamless user experience, no matter where I am.
